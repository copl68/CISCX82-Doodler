# Doodle App
### Overview 
This app is meant as an introduction to android development. The majority of the app serves as a blank canvas for the user to draw on. By using the buttons on the
bottom, the user is able to edit the appearance of the brush stroke on the screen. Through these buttons, the user can change the brush color, size, and opacity.
The user can also clear the canvas whenever they'd like so that they may start again on a blank canvas.

### How to run
The best way to run this software is to unzip the folder and open the project in Android Studio. Once in Android Studio, make sure that you have some sort of emulator 
set up and ready to use. Once this is done, simply press the "play" button in the top toolbar to launch the emulator and experiment with the app.
